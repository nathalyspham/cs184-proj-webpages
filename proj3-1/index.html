<p>Here are a few problems students have encountered in the past. Test your website on the instructional machines early!</p>
<ul>
<li>Your main report page should be called index.html.</li>
<li>Be sure to include and turn in all of the other files (such as images) that are linked in your report!</li>
<li>Use only <em>relative</em> paths to files, such as <pre>"./images/image.jpg"</pre>
Do <em>NOT</em> use absolute paths, such as <pre>"/Users/student/Desktop/image.jpg"</pre></li>
<li>Pay close attention to your filename extensions. Remember that on UNIX systems (such as the instructional machines), capitalization matters. <pre>.png != .jpeg != .jpg != .JPG</pre></li>
<li>Be sure to adjust the permissions on your files so that they are world readable. For more information on this please see this tutorial: <a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html">http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Permissions.html</a></li>

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
In this assignment we implemented ray tracing algorithms to render scenes. In part 1, we first worked on generating rays from a coordinate in an image to world space and pixel samples. 
Then we implemented primitive intersection algorithm which finds the intersection between a ray and a shape. In part 2 implemented the BVH to speed up our path tracer to identifying intersections. This was an important part of our project as we realized without a proper implementation here, all other parts are rendered significantly slowly. 
In part 3 we implemented direct illumination by calculating zero-bounce and one-bounce radiance. In part 4, we calcualted the indirect radiance by recursion to simulate the effect light bouncing off objects. The combination of direct and indirect illumination allowed us to render realistic shading for the models. 
Lastly in part 5 we implemented importance sampling to sample more in areas where there are more changes in the radiance thus reducing noise in our rendered images. Together, in this assignment we are able to use ray-tracing algorithms to efficiently render images with realistic illumination.

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection (20 Points)</h2>
<!-- Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
Show images with normal shading for a few small .dae files. -->

<h3>
  Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
</h3>
<p>
I generated the ray by calculating where it should be on the image frame. We know that the ray starts as pos, which is the position of the camera. Then we just need to calculate the direction to generate the ray. To do this, first I subtracted -0.5 from x and y so that the frame is centered at (0,0). Then I found the relative position of x and y in camera space by multiplying them by 2*tan(hFov)/2 and 2*tan(vFov)/2, respectively. I constructed a vector with the new(x, y, -1),  then multiplied it by the camera to world matrix and normalized it, and let this vector be v. This was the desired direction vector. So I returned Ray(pos, v) and also set the min_t and max_t of the ray.  
</p>
<p>
For the primitive intersection part of the pipeline, if we do not intersect with a given object (triangle or sphere) we simply return false, otherwise, we can find information about the intersection and we set all the attributes of this intersection such as it’s time, normal, and primitive and return the intersection.
</p>
<br>

<h3>
  Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
</h3>
<p>
  On a higher level, I achieved this by first detecting whether the ray intersects with the plane of the triangle, then using barycentric coordinates to find whether the point of intersection is within the triangle. But this was achieved in a simple fashion through the Möller–Trumbore algorithm. We closely followed the equations on the lecture slides to implement this algorithm.

      </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>
  Then, we check that t_min<=t<=t_max, which shows that the ray intersects with the plane. We also check that 0<=b1<=1, 0<=b2<=1, 0<=(1-b1-b2)<=1, this checks whether each barycentric coordinate of the interpolated point is valid such that the pointer is inside the triangle. Hence if all these conditions are met, we can return true, meaning that the ray did intersect the triangle. Otherwise we return false because either the ray didn't intersect with the plane or intersected the plane on a point outside of the triangle.

<h3>
  Walk through your implementation of the indirect lighting function.
</h3>
<p>
  We implemented at_least_one_bounce_radiance with recursion. We utilized Russian roulette to eventually terminate the algorithm, with a termination probability of 0.3. During one recursive call, we first get L_out calling one_bounce_radiance. Then if coin_flip(0.7) is true, we continue with the recursion otherwise we just return L_out. If we decide we will continue the recursion, we first get a new sample from the bsdf with w_out. Then when generating a new ray next_r with the return wi_d. We set the depth of this ray as the depth of the current ray -1 and the min_t of the next ray as EPS_F. We calculate the cos theta as the dot product of the normal of the intersection and wi_d multiplied by the object-to-world matrix. Then if next_r’s depth is still >= 1, and bvh->intersect(next_r,&next_i) returns true, we continue with the recursion. In that case, we find the return value of the next_ray and a new intersection, let this value be r_recursed. Then finally we add this to L_out as  r_recursed * sample from bsdf * cos theta/ pdf from bsdf / 0.7 and return L_out in the end. The implemention mostly followed this slide from lecture.

  </table>
</div>
  <p>
  Then, we implemented est_radiance_global_illumination to account for direct and indirect illustration. Hence we return L_out as the sum of values returned by zero_bound_randiance +at_least_one_bounce_radiance which are the direct (zero- and one- time bounce) and indirect (more than one-time bounce) illumination radiance summed.

<p>
It may be seen in that in the image generated with only direct illumination, only the faces of facing the light source and the light source itself are lit up as direct illumination is only the zero time and once time bounce. The indirect image is really interesting as it seems as if there are light sources placed everywhere, but this is because the indirect case shows the light resulting from bounces that are not the first one so it looks like it came from many directions.

<p>
It may be seen that having more ray-depth resulted in images that are brighter in general. This is because the rays are able to be traced further by the algorithm, bouncing off more times and increasing radiance in the process. The change as max_ray_depth increase is quite significant and visible when max_ray_depth is small.

<h3>
  Explain adaptive sampling. Walk through your implementation of the adaptive sampling.
</h3>
<p>
  Adaptive sampling detects whether a pixel has converged as we trace ray samples through it. Through this, it reduces noise in the ray-traced image as it concentrates on sampling in more difficult parts of the image so it doesn't sample the same for each pixel. Our implementation closely follows the formula given in the spec. Within every loop of sampling, we now check if loop i modular samplesperbatch is = 0 because then we need to check for convergence. To check for convergence, we calculate the standard division and mean using s1 and s2 variables which we tracked during the sampling loop. From there, we calculated I=1.96*std/(current number of loops completed) and checked whether I<=maxTolerance*mean, if this is true, we break out of the loop because we have “converged” already and don’t need to sample further here, otherwise the loop continues as usual.

  It may be seen that after implementing task 5, the sample rate is a lot larger in places with more change in radiance whereas areas where the light is more consistent is sampled a lot less. This demonstrates the effectivness of adaptive sampling in reducing the number of samples in some areas and hence reducing noise in the rendered image.
