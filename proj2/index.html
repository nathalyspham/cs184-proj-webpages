<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    As an overview, we implemented the evaluation for bezier curves and surface, and also the tools needed to implement loop sub-division for triangular meshes. We implemented the evaluation of 1D Bezier curves and 2D Bezier surfaces. Then, we implemented different parts of half-edge operations to support loop sub-division. First we implemented Area-Weighted Vertex Normals to compute the normal of a vertex based on its surrounding faces. Then we implemented split and flip operations, which creates new edges in triangles and reassigns pointers to achieve splitting edges and flipping them. Finally, using them together, we implemented loop sub-division which divides the existing mesh into smaller meshes creating a smoother volumn that is consisting of more meshes just by dividing the existing initial meshes.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    The de Casteljau algorithm finds the points at the ratio t between all points, and it does this repeatedly
	 until there is only one point left. This point will be on the resulting Bezier curve at parameter t. To
	  implement one step of this algorithm, we iterate through all the points and use linear interpolation to
	   find new points. For given point pi, pi+1, and t, the new point p would be at pi + t * (pi+1 - pi).

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    We use the separable 1D de Casteljau, as defined in lecture. We can first apply the de Casteljau algorithm in dimension u to define control points for
	 the moving curve in dimension v, and then we can apply the de Casteljau algorithm in v to get the final point. 
</p>
<p>
	We implemented this by using three separate functions. evaluateStep() performs one step of de Casteljau, like in task 1, and evaluate1D() runs de Casteljau
	 fully in one dimension by calling evaluateStep until there is only 1 point left. evaluate() runs de Casteljau fully in 2 dimensions to evaluate the Bezier
	  patch at parameter (u, v).  It calls evaluate1D() for all of u (all the rows) to get the moving curve, and then, it finds the final point by calling evaluate1D()
	   for v on the points of the moving curve.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    To calculate the area-weighted vertex normals, we used the formula from lecture where the
	 vertexNormalVector = (the sum of the facesNormalVectors) / (the euclidean norm of the sum
	  of the facesNormalVectors). We also had to weight the normals of the faces by their area,
	   and we found this area by using the cross product of two of the face’s vectors to get a
	    normal vector. The magnitude of this normal vector is proportional to the area of the
		 face. We were already provided a method to find the normal vector of a face, so we just
		  multiplied the magnitude of that vector with the vector itself. We then did this
		   for every face that touches the vertex and added them together. Then, we just divided
		    by the norm to get a normalized unit vector.

<p>
    We followed the strategy of the image below in order to accomplish the flip operation. We first set pointers to all of the items: 6
	 inside halfedges, 4 outside halfedges, 2 faces, 4 vertices, 5 edges. We kept the locations of the inside halfedges in
	  relation to each other the same. We took all the inside halfedges and rotated them clockwise. The faces stayed the same too
	   because we made the left face the new top face. What we changed were the locations of the halfedges, and we did this by changing the
	    vertices, edges, and twins they were associated with. For example, h2’s vertex would change from v2 to v0, its edge from e2 to e3,
		 and its twin from h7 to h8, and its next and face would stay the same. We went through all the halfedges and changed their next, twin,
		  vertex, edge, and face pointers like the below image using setNeighbors. Then, we went through all the vertices, edges, and faces and
		   changed their halfedge pointer to be the new one they are associated with.

    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    I think setting pointers to everything at the beginning and making a clear visual of where stuff moves helped me a lot to avoid bugs. Getting
	 started was definitely the hardest part for me. I was really confused before I saw the before and after image on EdStem. I understood that you need a lot
	  of pointers and then you need to move a bunch of stuff, but I kept getting lost in my own logic. My naming convention was also really bad and
	   confusing. For a halfedge, I called it ab if it was going from vertex a to vertex b, and it made it harder for me to see what it should look
	    like after the flip when the vertices were supposed to change. After I implemented this function, I set a screenshot of my teapot with flipped
		 edges to my friend because I thought it was weird how it became indented, and he said it looked weird because his never indented. And I spent
		  so long trying to debug this, and he updated me and said that he never tried that specific edge and that I was right the whole time T.T. I
		   get now that this indent occurs because the new edge connects the other two vertices, so it goes from being convex to concave.

<p>
    Similar to task 4, we started by creating pointers for all of the halfedges, faces, vertices, and edges. Then, we created 6 halfedges, 2
	 faces, 1 vertex, and 3 edges. We thought of this task as pushing the inside up, so the left face becomes the top left face, and e0 becomes
	  the edge between the vertices c and m. And the newly created items fill in the rest. We then use setNeighbors for all of the halfedges and
	   set all the halfedge pointers for the vertices, edges, and faces to their corresponding halfedges.

<p>
    My naming scheme of using am for vertex a to vertex m was super helpful in this task because nothing
	 moved around, and I could easily track all of the pointers. The only issue I had with this task was that
	  I forgot to set the position of the new vertex (m->position()). Spots in my mesh would collapse
	   inwards whenever I would call splitEdge since the vertex position would default to (0, 0, 0). Everything else went
	    smoothly :)!

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    I implemented loop subdivison closely following the instructions given in the starter code. First, I computed the new position for all of the new vertices and updated positions for old vertices using the two formulas taught in lecture, and assigned is_new as false for them. I stored those new coordinates in the new_positions attribute. Then, I looped over the old set of edges to split each of them. I also modified split from part 5, such that the new edges are assigned as is_new such that we can flip the right vertices. Lastly, I flipped the edges where the edgre was new, and one vertex is old and one vertex is new. Lastly, I looped over all vertices to assign their positions to new_positions. Some bugs I encountered are that at first I was confused about where to set the new edges. I originally wrote split_vertex->halfedge()->edge()->isNew = true; and split_vertex->halfedge()->twin()->edge()->isNew = true; and this was buggy. Then I looked more closely to find out which edges exactly are "new" in split, and assigned them there. This was important to fix because in later steps of performing this subdivision, when checking if an edge is "new" we are able to retrieve correct results and flip accordingly. 
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
	I noticed that around corners and edges, it becomes more "smooth" after loop subdivison. Sharp edges no longer hold and it seems to become more of an average of the two faces that it was originally next to so it becomes more round. An example is the cube. It may be seen that initially, it had distinct triangular faces and edges, but after each subdivision, each edge gets more smooth and close to the adjacent edges such that the shape as a whole becomes more spherical at the end.

	</div>
	However, if I pre-split some of the edges that are on the same face, it does reduce the effect. This is because then each triangle will be adjacent to more triangles that is on the same face as it originally, so the adjacent edges on another face will not have as huge of an "averaging" or "smoothening" effect. The triangles which are only adjacent to triangles on the same plane, for example, would have been split into faces that are on another plane so it would maintain the edges better. I did this by splitting each face of the cube 5 times. I split the diagonal edge, then splitted each of the four edges on that face. Then, when running loop sub-division the shape looks much more than a cube. Then sharp edge still smoothened, but is it more visible that there used to be an edge there and that the volume is more close to a cube.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>
<p>
	I showed this in the previous question, but I added the images again so it is easier to see. The cube does become asymmetric after loop sub-divison, and I think this is due to the fact that each face of the square isn't symmetric to start with, considering the diagonal in the middle. Then each triangle has different spatial relations to its surrounding triangles, hence the asymmetric result after the splitting and flipping.

	</div>
	Hence, to preprocess the cube such that it will have a symmetric loop subdivision, I split the diagonal edge once so that there are 4 triangles on each face of the cube. Now when performing the subdivision process, it will stay symmetric. Now, each triangle's relative position to triangles nearby is now the same and each face is symmetric to start with(one traingle adjacent is at the bottom longer edge on another face, each shorter edge is adjacent to a short edge of a perpendicular triangle on the same face) and subdivision happens symmetrically.
