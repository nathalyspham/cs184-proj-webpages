<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    The de Casteljau algorithm finds the points at the ratio t between all points, and it does this repeatedly
	 until there is only one point left. This point will be on the resulting Bezier curve at parameter t. To
	  implement one step of this algorithm, we iterate through all the points and use linear interpolation to
	   find new points. For given point pi, pi+1, and t, the new point p would be at pi + t * (pi+1 - pi). 
</p>

<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    We use the separable 1D de Casteljau, as defined in lecture. We can first apply the de Casteljau algorithm in dimension u to define control points for
	 the moving curve in dimension v, and then we can apply the de Casteljau algorithm in v to get the final point. 
</p>
<p>
	We implemented this by using three separate functions. evaluateStep() performs one step of de Casteljau, like in task 1, and evaluate1D() runs de Casteljau
	 fully in one dimension by calling evaluateStep until there is only 1 point left. evaluate() runs de Casteljau fully in 2 dimensions to evaluate the Bezier
	  patch at parameter (u, v).  It calls evaluate1D() for all of u (all the rows) to get the moving curve, and then, it finds the final point by calling evaluate1D()
	   for v on the points of the moving curve.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    To calculate the area-weighted vertex normals, we used the formula from lecture where the
	 vertexNormalVector = (the sum of the facesNormalVectors) / (the euclidean norm of the sum
	  of the facesNormalVectors). We also had to weight the normals of the faces by their area,
	   and we found this area by using the cross product of two of the face’s vectors to get a
	    normal vector. The magnitude of this normal vector is proportional to the area of the
		 face. We were already provided a method to find the normal vector of a face, so we just
		  multiplied the magnitude/euclidean length of that vector with itself. We then did this
		   for every face that touches the vertex and added them together. Then, we just divided
		    by the norm to get a normalized unit vector.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>


<b>

			<img src="images/Screenshot 2023-02-28 at 11.31.37 AM.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
</div>

<p>
    We followed the strategy of the image below in order to accomplish the flip operation. We first set pointers to all of the items in the
	 two triangles: 6 inside halfedges, 4 outside halfedges, 2 faces, 4 vertices, 5 edges. We kept the locations of the inside halfedges in
	  relation to each other the same. It’s like we took all the inside halfedges and rotated them clockwise. The faces stayed the same too
	   because we made the left face the new top face. What we changed were the locations of the halfedges, and we did this by changing the
	    vertices, edges, and twins they were associated with. For example, h2’s vertex would change from v2 to v0, its edge from e2 to e3,
		 and its twin from h7 to h8, and its next and face would stay the same. We went through all the halfedges and changed their next, twin,
		  vertex, edge, and face pointers like the below image using setNeighbors. Then, we went through all the vertices, edges, and faces and
		   changed their halfedge pointer to be the new one they are associated with.

    Write about your eventful debugging journey, if you have experienced one.
</b>
<p>
    I think setting pointers to everything at the beginning and making a clear visual of where stuff moves helped me a lot to avoid bugs. Getting
	 started was definitely the hardest part for me. I was really confused before I saw the above image on edstem. I understood that you need a lot
	  of pointers and then you need to move a bunch of stuff, but I kept getting lost in my own logic. My naming convention was also really bad and
	   confusing. For a halfedge, I called it ab if it was going from vertex a to vertex b, and it made it harder for me to see what it should look
	    like after the flip when the vertices were supposed to change. After I implemented this function, I set a screenshot of my teapot with flipped
		 edges to my friend because I thought it was weird how it became indented, and he said it looked weird because his never indented. And I spent
		  so long trying to debug this, and he updated me and said that he never tried that specific edge and that I was right the whole time T.T. I
		   get that this indent occurs because the new edge connects the other two vertices, so it goes from being convex to concave.

</b>
<p>
    Similar to task 4, we started by creating pointers for all of the halfedges, faces, vertices, and edges. Then, we created 6 halfedges, 2
	 faces, 1 vertex, and 3 edges. We thought of this task as pushing the inside up, so the left face becomes the top left face, and e0 becomes
	  the edge between the vertices c and m. And the newly created items fill in the rest. We then use setNeighbors for all of the halfedges and
	   set all the halfedge pointers for the vertices, edges, and faces to their corresponding halfedges.

<p>
    My naming scheme of using am for vertex a to vertex m was super helpful in this task because nothing
	 moved around, and I could easily track all of the pointers. The only issue I had with this task was that
	  I forgot to set the position of the new vertex (m->position()), so spots in my mesh would collapse
	   inwards whenever I would call splitEdge since position would default to (0, 0, 0). Everything else went
	    smoothly :)!
